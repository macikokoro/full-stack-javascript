# About Me

I'm a Full Stack JavaScript bootcamp gradute. This book is my contribution to the open source community. My goal is to create a guide to help you get started developing with the MEAN stack and help you on your way to become an awesome developer.

## Note:

My development enviroment is in Mac OS X and I highly recommend it. If you must develop in a different environment Linux is the next best thing. Please make sure to have access to either before starting to read this book.
