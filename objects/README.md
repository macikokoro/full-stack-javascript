# Objects

Objects are containers of related information. Multiple pieces of data, called properties, are grouped within an Object.

Everyday things can be represented with JS Objects, for instance we could represent a book.

| Book Object |
| :--- |
| Properties |
| title |
| author |
| publisher |
| illustrator |
| country |

## Properties

Every property is an important bit of data associated with a book. An Object also contains multiple bits of info, this is often called a "composite value".

## Values

Just like everyday Objects, properites can point to specific ammonts or qualities. This means that properties can have assigned values.
