# Angular Project Set-up

Folder structure: app/server.js

Create a package.json file `npm init`

Install express as a dependency `npm install express --save`

Install nodemon as a dev dependency `npm install nodemon --save-dev`

Create server.js

At this point if you are only working on the html and css is best to use nodemon to reload your page automatically every time a change is made. Run with `$ nodemon` in a separate shell tab.
